Shortcodes with visitor's info. Also enables usage of conditional content.

== Description ==

The plugin enables user to add various data from visitor in the content as a shortcode. Some use cases:

- Doctors in New York love this device (New York gets replaced by the user's city)
- Is your iPhone screen broken? (iPhone is gets replaced)
- Slovenians are the smartest people in the world. (Slovenians gets replaced)

It is also possible to output content conditionally. Let's say you want to show some content only for EU users (GDPR). Just wrap the content in suitable shortcode and it will only get displayed for users in EU. The same goes for excluding content.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `personalized-shortcode-pro.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
