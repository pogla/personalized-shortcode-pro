Shortcodes with all the visitor's info that we can get (country, IP, country phone code, country flag emoji, city...).
It's also possible to write conditional content. If you want to exclude or include some content only for specific countries, continents or any other attribute you can easily achieve it with this plugin.

== Description ==

The plugin enables user to add various data from visitor in the content as a shortcode. Some use cases:

- Doctors in New York love this device (New York gets replaced by the user's city)
- Is your iPhone screen broken? (iPhone is gets replaced)
- Slovenians are the smartest people in the world. (Slovenians gets replaced)

It is also possible to output content conditionally. Let's say you want to show some content only for EU users (GDPR). Just wrap the content in suitable shortcode and it will only get displayed for users in EU. The same goes for excluding content.

To see all the attributes, visit [documentation page](https://maticpogladic.com/personalized-shortcode-pro).
