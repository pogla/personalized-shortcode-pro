# Personalized Shortcodes Pro

Shortcodes with visitor's info. Also enables usage of conditional content. The plugin is based on ipstack.com API.

## Description

The plugin enables user to add various data from visitor in the content as a shortcode. Some use cases:

- Doctors in New York love this device (New York gets replaced by the user's city)
- Is your iPhone screen broken? (iPhone is gets replaced)
- Slovenians are the smartest people in the world. (Slovenians gets replaced)

It is also possible to output content conditionally. Let's say you want to show some content only for EU users (GDPR), just wrap the content in suitable shortcode and it will only get displayed for users in EU. The same goes for excluding content.

Note: if visitor is using mobile data internet, information might not be correct. There is no way around it.
